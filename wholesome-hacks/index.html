			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<div>
				<strong>When is Wholesome Hacks?</strong>
				<p>Wholesome Hacks will be on Saturday, March 31st. The event will start at 11:00 am and conclude at 10:00 pm.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<strong>Where is Wholesome Hacks?</strong>
				<p>Wholesome Hacks will be hosted in the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Student+Activity+Center/@30.28491,-97.7360057,15z">SAC South Ballroom (SAC 2.412)</a>.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<strong>What is a hackathon?</strong>
				<p>A hackathon is a magical event where students spend hours and hours building an idea into reality. It's about learning new things and coming up with creative solutions with technology. We know this sounds a little mysterious, so why don’t you come and find out what we’re all about?</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<strong>Why come to Wholesome Hacks?</strong>
				<p>Whether you’ve never been to a hackathon or are a hackathon wizard level 500, we welcome hackers at all levels of experience. For hackathon newbies, we’ll host workshops to help you figure out a potential project (music visualizer, anyone?). As always, we’ll have mentors to help answer any questions!</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<strong>Who can attend?</strong>
				<p>Any UT student can join if they are over 18 years old! This includes undergraduates and grad students. You don't need to be a computer science or engineering major.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<strong>Any rules?</strong>
				<p>All code must be written at the event. You can't demo something you didn't build. Don't talk about Fight Club. All attendees (hackers, supporters, mentors, volunteers, etc) must abide by <a href="https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf">MLH's Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<strong>What should I bring?</strong>
				<p>Yourself, your valid UT ID, a form of ID proving you are over 18 years old, a laptop, chargers, or anything else you might need within the 12 hours. Firearms, weapons, alcohol, illegal drugs, and power tools are not allowed. Smiles and high-fives welcome.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<strong>How much money will this cost me?</strong>
				<p>Zero. Zip. Zilch. Nada. Nothing. Gratis. It's free. Freetail Hackers provides students with WiFi, meals, swag, workspace, and prizes for all of our events, including Wholesome Hacks!</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<strong>How do teams work?</strong>
				<p>Teams can be up to 4 members. If you don't have a team, check out our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/freetailhackers/">Facebook group</a> for attendees. Joining a team of new friends is the best part of a hackathon!</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<strong>I don't have a team.</strong>
				<p> We will facilitate team formations at the start of the event. Don’t be shy!</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<strong>What do I do when I get there?</strong>
				<p>You’ll check-in at our help desk. We’ll give you a wristband which will grant access to food and swag. From there on out, you can decide whether you want to attend a workshop, look for a team, or start hacking!</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<strong>What are the prizes?</strong>
				<p>The winning team will receive automatic admission to HackTX and spicy unique trophies!</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<strong>Who are the Freetail Hackers?</strong>
				<p>We’re a group of UT Austin students who love organizing hackathons for the community. We also love going to them. If you enjoy both of these, you should join our team. Applications open Spring 2019!</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<strong>I have another question.</strong>
				<p>Please email us at <a href="mailto:admin@freetailhackers.com">admin@freetailhackers.com</a> if you still have any questions! We will be happy to answer them.</p>
