                A Learnathon is a virtual two-day event held on April 3rd and 4th by Freetail Hackers for students of ALL backgrounds to learn about technology. 
                We want to create an inclusive space for anyone interested in technology to learn and explore it. Attendees will get the chance to learn new skills, 
                meet other people going through the learning journey, and create a project to showcase!

                        The Learnathon is designed to help people from all backgrounds transform from tadpoles to code toads! 
                        On Saturday, April 3rd, we will have a day specifically designed for workshops. 
                        Most of these workshops will assume no prior knowledge and will be a space for anyone to learn. 
                        On Sunday, April 4th, we will have a hackathon that will give attendees a chance to use what they have learned to build a project. 
                        This can sound scary at first but we will give you the tools you need to go from no programming experience to building a project! 
                        Of course, the experience can be personalized as attendees have the option of attending just one or both of the two events.

                        Additionally, all workshops will be recorded unless noted otherwise, so don’t worry if you can’t make it to a specific time; 
                        you can always watch afterwards.

                There are many resources we've prepared to help learn this weekend. The first is our <a class="links" href="https://freetailhackers.com/uhsg/">Ultimate Hackathon Starting Guide (UHSG)</a>. 
                This was created by our teach and consists of tutorials, starter code, and links to more resources for the main technologies people use at hackathons.
                It goes over common hackathon logistics, whether or not you should use a certain technology, and where to get started with your project.
                The second resource is our <a class="links" href='https://www.youtube.com/c/FreetailHackers'>Youtube Channel</a> which contains all the workshops from our past year of events. 
                If you don't see a topic you are interested in or just want to learn more about a certain area, feel free to browse around our channel and look for it.
                Finally, all of the organizers and mentors will be active on Discord to support you. We are all here to see you learn and succeed. 
                Don't hesistate to reach out to us if you are feeling uncertain or have any questions!

                Applications will be posted on our Facebook page. Need to reach out to us for any further questions or want to work with us for the next event?

                As mentioned, the Learnathon is designed for everyone. In order to have a space that truly fosters growth, 
                we require that all our attendees, mentors, and organizers are respectful of each other. 
                To that end, all participants are expected to follow the 
                <a class="links" href="https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf">MLH Code of Conduct</a>
                to facilitate a safe space and positive hackathon experience for everyone!
