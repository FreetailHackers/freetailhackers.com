              <p>
                We're a group of UT Austin students who love organizing
                hackathons for college students. We also love going to them. If
                you enjoy both of these, you should apply to our team when
                applications open in Fall or Spring! Applications will be posted
                on our Instagram (<a

            <h2 class="faq-title mb-3">How do teams work?</h2>
            <p class="mb-3">
              Teams can be up to 4 members. If you don't have a team, don't
              worry! Joining a team of new friends is the best part of a
              hackathon. We will have team matching available for everyone on
              the day of the event, but if you would like to message our channel
              and create a team beforehand, that's okay too! We will have a form
              to fill out and confirm team information.
            </p>
            <h2 class="faq-title mb-3">How much money will this cost me?</h2>
            <p class="mb-3">
              Zero. Zip. Zilch. Nada. Nothing. Gratis. It's free!!! Freetail
              Hackers will provide all attendees workshops, food, tech talks,
              fun events, and prizes at no cost to you!!
            </p>
            <h2 class="faq-title mb-3">Any Rules?</h2>
            <p class="mb-3">
              All work must be done during the 24-hour period of the event. You
              can't demo something you didn't build. All attendees (hackers,
              supporters, mentors, volunteers, etc.) must abide by the

            <h2 class="faq-title mb-3">I am a mentor, what should I expect?</h2>
            <p class="mb-3">
              We thank you for taking the time to guide our students in
              technical and non-technical aspects to help them design,
              implement, present, and think about their projects! You do not
              need any prior programming knowledge to mentor. We do not require
              that you stay on-call or be available throughout the entire
              hackathon, but at least contribute 2 hours at your flexibility and
              help students at either the mentor lounge, office hours or through
              the discord server. We will be providing all mentors with lunch,
              dinner, snacks, a complimentary boba drink, and the opportunity to
              interact with students through games, workshops, or other events!
