<p class="the-learnathon-is">The Learnathon is designed to help people from all backgrounds transform from tadpoles to code toads! On Saturday, April 3rd, we will have a day specifically designed for workshops. Most of these workshops will assume no prior knowledge and will be a space for anyone to learn. On Sunday, April 4th, we will have a hackathon that will give attendees a chance to use what they have learned to build a project. This can sound scary at first but we will give you the tools you need to go from no programming experience to building a project! Of course, the experience can be personalized as attendees have the option of attending just one or both of the two events.
